                    <li>The purpose of this product is to build a system that will help people to get pure clean water with just few clicks and in a affordable cost. The bussiness model of our app works like that there are number of suppliers that can subscribe to us and those suppliers can supply water to the people that are close to them. This enables us to cover more ground that ultimately helps people good product and in reasonable time. </li>
                    <li>People can register to our app and whenever they need water bottles, they can check our app which is the closest supplier to them, whom can deliver to them in a reasonable time and cost. User can decide and then order the bottles. The app model is somewhat similar to food panda but the point there is no such system exists for the distribution of water. Even the big brands like “Nestle” doesn’t even have online or automation system for that.</li>
