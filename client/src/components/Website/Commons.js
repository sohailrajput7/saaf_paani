                  Safe drinking water is one of the basic requirements of healthy and hygienic living.
                   According to official survey reports, 79% water samples collected from rural areas of 
                   12 Districts in the province of Punjab were found to be unsafe for human consumption, while 88%
                    water samples collected from rural areas of 21 Districts of the province were also found to be unsafe.

                  According to a report of Consumer Rights Commission of Pakistan, supported by the Japan Fund for Global Environment (JFGE), every 5th Pakistani child under the age of five suffers from waterborne diseases; and roughly 50 percent of mortality and 40% of hospital admissions are also caused by waterborne diseases. This situation is seriously hampering Pakistanâ€™s endeavors to attain health and poverty-related Millennium Development Goals.

                  In order to address this situation, the Government of Punjab has endeavored to develop a program to improve water supply in terms of, both, access and quality of drinking water, especially in unserved and underserved areas i.e. rural and peri-urban areas of the province. The Punjab Saaf Pani Company (PSPC) has been established as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to conceive, plan, design, execute and manage projects for provision of safe drinking water to the communities living in those areas.
